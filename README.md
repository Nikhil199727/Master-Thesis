Abstract

 Public organizations are increasingly reevaluating procurement practices to align
 with sustainability goals. This thesis investigates the integration of sustainable
 procurement within public entities, through a comparative analysis of two case
 studies: "YORBuild Sustainable Construction" in the UK and "USA-Sustainable
 Waste Transport." YORBuild, in the UK, employs a collaborative framework
 among local government bodies in Yorkshire and Humber. With a Â£300 million
 annual procurement budget over four years, YORBuild focuses on sustainable de
velopment across a diverse region. The case study highlights innovative procure
ment, inclusivity, and community engagement, serving as a model for sustainable
 construction, emphasizing integration of SMEs and customized collaboration.
 
 In the "USA-Sustainable Waste Transport" case study, the Metropolitan Re
gional Government of Portland, Oregon, addresses waste management while pri
oritizing environmental stewardship, local growth, and community involvement.
 The case demonstrates impact through diverse transportation methods, commu
nity engagement, and transparent partner selection. Regional governance align
ment and actionable sustainability measures benefit the community.

 The comparative analysis yields insights into environmentally responsible pro
curement in public institutions. Transparency, community engagement, and tai
lored sustainability strategies emerge as crucial factors. Both cases underscore
 combination of environmental, social, and economic considerations, offering global
 government entities valuable lessons in positive impact, inclusivity, and responsi
ble decision-making.

 This thesis contributes to eco-friendly sourcing in governmental entities and
 advances environmentally conscious purchasing strategies in the public sector. It
 fosters a more sustainable future by addressing regional and community-specific
 needs
